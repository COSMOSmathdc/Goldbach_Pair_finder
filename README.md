# Goldbach_Pair_finder
This is the program for finding Goldbach pair for a even number in O(n^1.5) time complexity and O(1) Space Complexity
Goldbach conjecture states that any even positive integer greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes and this program findes a pair of primes that the entered even number is a sum of.
I hope you like and enjoy it
